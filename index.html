        <p class="main-text"> Welcome to my website. </p>
        <p class="main-text"> I decided to make this website as a way to demonstrate my journey in learning web development!. </p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p class="inline-text"> My name is Giuseppe D'Orazio and I am a computer science student at York University. I've been interested in technology and how it functions ever since
            I was young. I started programming in high school and have been learning ever since. 
        </p>

        <h2> Why does this site look like this? </h2>
        <p class = "inline-text"> The visual aesthetic of this website was inspired from webpages I discovered while browsing <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a>. 
            I wanted to create a similar retro feel with bright colors and simple layouts. Despite not being around for the early days of the internet, 
            I find the simplicity and charm of these designs appealing.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also find something to be admirable about the individuality of the old web. Each page was unique, reflecting the personality of its creator.
            This website is a small homage to that era, where creativity and self-expression was more commonplace about the internet. It's my way of combatting the 
            sameness of modern websites and social media platforms.
        </p>
